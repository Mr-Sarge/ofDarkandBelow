"Darkness Falls Across the Land."
The 'Terraria: of Dark and Below' Mod is a mod aimed to add content and simple fun to your playthrough. It comes with 3 Bosses, a good deal of new items, and all the more to slaughter. This mod is ran by nothing more than passion and fun, and yet contains  a darker theme with inspiration from Dark Souls.
Current Update: Return of The King (Sunken King Rework)
